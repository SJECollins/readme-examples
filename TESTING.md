# TESTING.md

The Testing section/document should demonstrate that the site has been thoroughly tested across different areas including validation, responsiveness, browser compatibility, accessibility, and manual and automated testing (depending on the project).

---

## Validators

*The validation carried out will depend on the project level, but all custom files should be validated.*

### HTML
All HTML pages within a project should be validated using the [W3C Markup Validation Service](https://validator.w3.org/).\
For projects using template tags, do not validate using the HTML files themselves. Either use the URL for a page or copy the page source in the browser. 

### CSS
Similarly, any CSS files should be validated using the [W3C CSS Validation Service](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/).  

### JavaScript (JShint)
All custom JavaScript code can be validated using [JShint](https://jshint.com/).
It would also be acceptable to use a linter in your workspace (e.g. [ESLint](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dbaeumer.vscode-eslint)) and report the results.

### Python (PEP8)
Python files can be validated using the [CI Python Linter (PEP8)](https://pep8ci.herokuapp.com/).  
It would also be acceptable to install a python linter directly in your workspace (e.g. [Pylint](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-python.pylint) or [flake8](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-python.flake8)) and report the results.

## Lighthouse Testing

*It's recommended to performed Lighthouse testing in incognito mode for best results.*

Google Chrome's Lighthouse tool was used to evaluate:
- Performance
- Accessibility
- Best Practices
- SEO

Screenshots of the Lighthouse results are included below:

*Insert screenshots here*

---

## Accessibility Testing

Lighthouse includes some accesibility testing, but there are more comprehensive accessibilty tools available, such as [WAVE Web Accessibility Evaluation Tool](https://wave.webaim.org/).  

---

## Browser Compatibility

*While Chrome is usually recommended for developing, it is a good idea to test the site in multiple browsers.*

The site was tested on the following browsers and versions:

| Browser  | Version  |
|----------|----------|
| Chrome   | XX.X     |
| Firefox  | XX.X     |
| Edge     | XX.X     |
| Brave    | XX.X     |

All pages rendered correctly and behaved as expected across these browsers.

---

## Responsiveness Testing

*Most projects (not PP3, the python terminal project) should be responsive across mobile, tablet and larger screens*

Responsiveness was tested using:
- Chrome DevTools with preset device views (e.g., iPhone SE, iPhone 12, iPad, Pixel 5, Galaxy S8)
- [Am I Responsive](https://ui.dev/amiresponsive) tool for screenshot and display

All content adjusted appropriately to different screen sizes. No overflow or layout issues were found.

---

## Manual User Testing

*Manual user testing should be carried out on all functionality of the site.*
*We can include User Story testing here, or as it's own section.*

Manual testing was conducted to ensure all features functioned as intended.

### Testing Table Example:

| Feature                     | Steps Taken                                      | Expected Result                                | Actual Result     |
|-----------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|-------------------|
| Contact Form Submission     | Fill in all fields and submit                    | Message is sent and confirmation shown         | Pass              |
| Navigation Bar              | Click each link on different screen sizes        | Navigates to correct section or page           | Pass              |
| Form Validation             | Submit empty form                                | Error messages appear                          | Pass              |
| Mobile Navigation           | Test hamburger menu on smaller screen            | Menu opens and links work as expected          | Pass              |

*This table can be expanded with additional features as needed.*

---

## Automated Testing *(e.g. jest, unittest)*

*Should aim for good coverage of custom files, not files generated by the framework used.*

Automated testing was done using Django's built-in testing tools.

- `unittest` was used to test views, forms, and models.
- The `coverage` package was used to check how much of the codebase was tested.

To run the tests:
```bash
python3 manage.py test
```

To check test coverage:
```bash
coverage run --source='.' manage.py test
coverage report
```

## Bugs
### Fixed Bugs

- **Issue One**:
    - **Description**: Details of the issue
    - **Fix**: Solution to bug

 - **Issue Two**:
    - **Description**: Details of the issue
    - **Fix**: Solution to bug

### Known Bugs

Can include details of known bugs which have not been resolved here.

All bugs encountered during development that can be fixed, should be. In rare cases unresolved bugs may be accepted, but these would typically be issues outside of the control of the developer.
