# Example README

The README should describe the planning, development, testing, and deployment of your project in enough detail to demonstrate your understanding of these processes for the assessor and your skills in all these aspects to others who may read this document (e.g. future employers).

The README should be primarily written in [markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/).

For early projects, the minimal sections included should be: introduction, features, testing, deployment, and credits.
As your projects become more complicated, the expectation is the documentation should become more detailed.
Ideally, all projects should have:
- Introduction (project overview, main image)
- Design (project goals, user stories, layout, colour and typography decisions, mockups, wireframes, etc.)
- Features (descriptions of features, their value to the users, features left to implement)
- Testing (validation, lighthouse, accessibility, browser, responsiveness, manual and automated tests, bugs fixed and unfixed)
- Deployment (specific steps on deploying the project to a hosting platform, how to clone and fork the project as a bonus)
- Credits (all sources of external code, images and content should be clearly credited with links to the sources)

Below is an example of a basic README for an early project:

# Project Name

## Overview

Provide a brief introduction to your project. This section should describe the purpose of the project, its target audience, and how it will be useful to them.

A main image of the project should be included in the introduction. A mockup on [amiresponsive](https://ui.dev/amiresponsive) is acceptable.

## Features

Describe the key features of your project, explaining their value to the user.

### Existing Features

- **Feature 1**  
  - Brief description of the feature and how it benefits the user.

- **Feature 2**  
  - Brief description of the feature and how it benefits the user.

- **Feature 3**  
  - Brief description of the feature and how it benefits the user.

### Features Left to Implement

- Planned future feature 1
- Planned future feature 2

## Testing

Describe the testing process and results to demonstrate that the project works as intended across different devices and screen sizes.

### Validator Testing

- **HTML**: No errors found using [W3C Validator](https://validator.w3.org/).
- **CSS**: No errors found using [Jigsaw Validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/).
- **JavaScript**: No errors found using [JSHint](https://jshint.com/).
- **Python**: No errors were found using [CI's PEP8 Linter](https://pep8ci.herokuapp.com/).

### Unfixed Bugs

List any known issues and explain why they have not been resolved.

## Deployment

Describe the process used to deploy the project to a hosting platform.
For the first two projects, this will typically be GitHub Pages like the Love Running project.
The other projects are usually deployed to Heroku which requires more detailed deployment steps

Steps to deploy:
1. Navigate to the repository settings.
2. Select the deployment method (e.g., GitHub Pages, Netlify, etc.).
3. Complete the deployment setup.
4. Share the live link here: [Project Live Link](https://example.com/)

## Additional Project Advice

- Use clear and meaningful commit messages ([Guide](https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)).
- Follow best coding practices ([HTML & CSS Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/htmlcssguide.html)).
- Maintain clear and organized file naming conventions.
