# CREDITS

The Credits section of a README should clearly document any sources used in the project including code, media, content, etc..

It is common in programming to use code from external sources (Stack Overflow is full of solutions for issues we all run into), but it is important that your README clearly acknowledges external sources to avoid plagiarism.

Sources should be as specific as possible, unlike the examples below avoid linking to "YouTube" or "Pexels". Try to always link to the specific image, video, Stack Overflow thread and give credit to authors where possible. This includes ChatGPT or other generative AI, we should make sure we identify what parts of our project were generated by AI.
