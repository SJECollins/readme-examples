## Design

The Design section outlines the design decisions made during development of the project, it typically includes details on colour schemes, typography, layout decisions, and any tools used to create wireframes or mockups.

This section helps demonstrate that the design was considered thoughtfully and supports the functionality and usability of the site.

### Colour Scheme

You should describe the chosen colour palette and explain your reasoning. For example:

> A soft, neutral colour palette was chosen to give the site a calm and clean appearance. Accent colours were used sparingly for buttons and highlights to draw attention to interactive elements.

Optionally, a palette image or link to a tool like [Coolors](https://coolors.co/) or [Adobe Color](https://color.adobe.com/) can be included.

### Typography

Include the font(s) used and why they were selected. For example:

> The site uses the "Roboto" font for its modern and clean appearance, paired with "Lora" for headings to provide contrast and readability.

You can also note where fonts were sourced from (e.g., Google Fonts) and if any fallbacks were defined in the CSS.

### Layout

Explain the general layout of the site, such as:

> A consistent layout is used across all pages with a fixed header, responsive navigation bar, and footer. Main content is centred and uses a grid layout for responsive design.

It can be helpful to mention if CSS Grid, Flexbox, or a framework like Bootstrap was used.

### Wireframes

Wireframes or mockups (if created during planning) should be included or linked here. These can be hand-drawn, made with tools like Balsamiq, Figma, or Canva.

> Example wireframes were created to map out the homepage and key user flows before development began.

You can embed images like:

```md

```
