## User Experience Design

This section discusses the design phase of the development of the project using the Five Planes of User Experience Design, based on the framework by Jesse James Garrett. The aim is to demonstrate that the project has been thoughtfully planned and designed with both user needs and project goals in mind.

This or the alternative [DESIGN](/DESIGN.md) document could be used, depending on your preferred format and level of detail.

### 2. Scope Plane

Translates the strategic goals into concrete feature and content requirements.

- Content type 1 (e.g., blog posts, user profiles, product listings)
- Content type 2

#### Out-of-Scope
- Optional: Mention features or functionality deliberately excluded from this version of the project

### 3. Structure Plane

Outlines the structure of the system and how users navigate and interact with it.

#### User Flow
- Brief description of the user journey or a flowchart diagram (embed or link)
